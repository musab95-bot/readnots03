** Dealing with Git** In order to save the work that is acheived we use Git to store this work for getting lost or damaged. we upload the file to githup by using Git.

** This can be acheived by the following steps:**

-making a repo on git-hup
-go to terminal and write cd desktop as it is like this in my laptop. This step is done to know where the file is
- Then chosing the place of the file
- creating the file name
- clone it by writing git clone and copying link of HTTPS
- it sould be in the file
- finally, pushing the file by using git push origin master
- if any changes have made on the file on HTML in visual studio, then it will copied to githup
